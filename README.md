# GatewayMQTT

My first experience using Go. 
Used Go 1.19.5 

A gateway for transmitting data measurements from equipment/meters of the microgrid model made in Matlab Simulink.
In this project are used:
  - Gin framework;
  - MQTT protocol (without security measures for data transmission (using TLS/SSL, setting a login and password for the client)).

In the future, additions / changes to the project are possible.
