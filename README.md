# GatewayMQTT

My first experience using Go. 
Used Go 1.19.3 

A gateway for transmitting data measurements from equipment/meters of the microgrid model made in Matlab Simulink.

In this project, the MQTT protocol was used for data transmission, operating at the application level on top of tcp/ip. 
In this project, there are no security measures for data transmission (using TLS/SSL, setting a login and password for the client). 

In the future, additions / changes to the project are possible.
