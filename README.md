# GatewayMQTT

My first experience using Go. The project was made solely for informational purposes.
Used Go 1.19.5 (now updated to 1.20)

A gateway for transmitting data measurements from equipment/meters of the microgrid model made in Matlab Simulink.
In this project are used:
  - Gin (a little exp);
  - MQTT (without security measures for data transmission (using TLS/SSL, setting a login and password for the client)).
